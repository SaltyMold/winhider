# Hotkeys

WinHider provides convenient keyboard shortcuts to quickly hide and unhide windows without needing to open the application interface.


## Default Hotkey Bindings

| Hotkey | Action |
| ------ | ------ |

| `Ctrl+S` | Hide/Unhide the selected window(s) from screen sharing |
| `Ctrl+T` | Hide/Unhide the selected window(s) from taskbar/task switcher |


## Using Hotkeys Effectively

1. **Focus First**: Make sure to click on the window you want to hide to bring it into focus
2. **Quick Toggling**: Use the corresponding unhide hotkey if you need to make the window visible again
3. **Process Info**: The `Ctrl+Shift+I` shortcut is useful for troubleshooting, as it shows details about the currently active window


## Troubleshooting Hotkeys

If hotkeys aren't working:

1. **Check for Conflicts**: Other applications might be using the same keyboard shortcuts
3. **Run as Administrator**: Some windows require elevated privileges to be modified
4. **Check Window Compatibility**: Some applications with custom rendering may not work with WinHider
